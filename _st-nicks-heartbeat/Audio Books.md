<p><strong>A Blessed Gift - A Bilingual Anthology of Faith Stories (Volume 1)</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Catholic alumnae have collaborated to publish a beautiful bilingual
anthology of faith stories: 'A Blessed Gift'.&nbsp; This labour of faith
and love has culminated in audio recordings, which we are pleased to share
with you.</p>
<p>This collection comprises 40 heartfelt narratives penned by our Catholic
old girls. Spanning across 8 decades, these stories of faith, love, and
resilience illuminate Godâ€™s immense love and mercy.</p>
<p>May hope you'll be touched and inspired by their compelling journeys.</p>
