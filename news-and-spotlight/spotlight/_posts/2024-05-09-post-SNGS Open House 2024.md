<p>Dear Parents and Primary Students,&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would like to express our sincerest appreciation to all who came for
our Open House last Saturday (4 May 2024). We hope you have enjoyed interacting
with our students and staff.</p>
<p>For those who missed the opportunity to attend because of competing commitments,
we have prepared a video recording comprising the <strong>Principal's talk</strong> (which
includes the key details of DSA (direct school admission) process, <strong>Q&amp;A</strong> (question-and-answer) <strong>segment with KPs</strong> (key
personnel) <strong>and our students</strong>) which you can access via

<p>Thank you once again for your support and we hope youâ€™ll #sayyestostnicks!</p>
