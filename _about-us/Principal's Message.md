Since the school’s establishment in 1933, CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School has been nurturing generations of accomplished young ladies who are anchored on sound values and driven by passion and purpose. 

As a catholic-mission SAP school, we offer a unique educational experience, one that is future-oriented, yet rich in culture and heritage. As a full school offering both a well-established GCE ‘O’ Level Programme as well as an innovative Integrated Programme, we offer a range of enriching and authentic learning experiences catered to the needs of our students. Our dynamic curriculum reflects our commitment to help every child realise her fullest potential. Our girls enjoy an extensive range of holistic experiences to help them cultivate their abilities and talents in pursuit of all-round excellence. Indeed, many of our girls have moved on to make an indelible mark and blaze new trails in numerous fields.   

What truly sets St Nicholas apart is our distinctive ethos and character. With a history spanning more than 8 decades, traditions are rich and ties, enduring. Like a rich tapestry that weaves through the lives of every staff and students, **饮水思源** (gratitude) and **姐妹同心** (sisterly love) are deeply embedded in the St Nick’s spirit. Our girls are blessed with many talents and are successful in so many areas. Yet, they continue to live out the IJ motto of **Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty**, possessing the humility to learn and improve, appreciating those who have helped them in ways big and small and placing others before self. The strong family culture continues to grow in the school. Our girls see each other as sisters, addressing each other affectionately as **姐姐** or **妹妹** and the friendships formed in this school will follow them for the rest of their lives. Moving ahead, we will continue to strengthen our spirit of gratitude and giving which has been so integral to the school’s ethos.   

As we prepare our girls for the increasingly volatile and complex world, we are mindful that the school has to continuously review and refresh our curriculum to ensure that our girls have the necessary qualities, competencies and dispositions to succeed in the future. To this end, we are guided by our vision to develop our students as **Girls of Grace ▪ Women of Strength ▪ Leaders with Heart**. By the time our girls graduate, we hope to have developed in them a strong moral compass to navigate the tumultuous world, the resilience to persevere through setbacks, and the desire to go beyond self to contribute to the larger community. We are confident that our girls will continue to shine brightly as role models and inspire the hearts and minds of those around them.   

As the adage goes, “It takes a village to raise a child.” The school is blessed to have the amazing support of the IJ Board, our parents, alumni and partners. We would like to express our heartfelt thanks and appreciation to all of them for their invaluable expertise, unstinting help and countless sacrifices. Together, we will continue to walk the journey with our girls. May the spirit of St Nicholas continue to touch the lives of generations to come!  
  
Thank you and God Bless

#### **校长的话**


圣尼各拉女校自1933年创校以来，培育了一代又一代以正确的价值观为导向，以满腔热情和极强的使命感来面对人生的杰出少女。

作为一所天主教特选学校，圣尼各拉女校为学生提供的，是面向未来，同时又强调丰富文化和传统的独特教育体验。圣尼各拉女校是中学和小学联办，并为中学生提供两种升学模式，包括完善的'O'水准课程，以及创新的综合课程（直通车计划）。我校秉持以学生为本的教育理念，为学生提供一系列充实和真实的学习体验，满足学生的学习需求。我校也致力于通过提供丰富多彩的课程来帮助每一个孩子发挥最大的潜能。圣尼各拉女校的学生通过广泛的全面多元学习体验，培养才能，积极乐学，追求卓越。事实上，我校的许多校友在毕业之后都在不同的领域开拓创新，做出显著的贡献。

圣尼各拉女校的独特校风和学生的优良品质正是我校与众不同的地方。我校育人80余载，圣尼各拉大家庭的优良传统历久弥新，情谊深长，“饮水思源”和“姐妹同心”的精神早已深深植根于圣尼各拉女校的大家庭中。圣尼各拉女校的学生才华横溢，很有天赋，无论是在课业、课外活动或人生的许多领域中都很成功。然而，她们都不忘校训“德纯义坚”，继续在生活中谦逊学习，精益求精，爱人如己，也懂得饮水思源。我们的学生都视彼此为姐妹，亲切地以“姐姐”或“妹妹”相称。展望未来，我们会继续强调感恩和奉献的精神，提醒学生要“饮水思源”。

我校意识到，我们在帮助学生为充满变数和日益复杂的世界做好准备的同时，也必须不断检讨和适时更新学校课程，以确保我们的学生都具备未来成功所需的素质、能力和品质。为此，我们以学校的愿景为导向，致力将学生培养成“娴雅少女，坚毅巾帼，仁爱领袖”。希望学生在毕业离校之后，都能够在动荡多变的世界中以正确价值观为导向、能够在面对挫折时坚忍不拔、能够超越自我为社会做出贡献。相信无论身在何处，圣尼各拉女校的学生都能散发耀眼光芒，成为启发他人的楷模。

所谓“十年树木，百年树人”，教育事业任重道远。圣尼各拉女校感恩能够得到圣婴董事会、家长、校友和合作伙伴的大力支持。在此，我们要由衷感谢圣尼各拉女校大家庭的成员提供了宝贵的专业知识，慷慨的帮助和无私的奉献。让我们继续与学生携手共进，继续将圣尼各拉女校大家庭的精神发扬光大！

感谢大家，祈愿天主保佑我们。
