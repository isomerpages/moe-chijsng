<p>A warm welcome to the CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School (SNGS) family!</p>
<p>Since the school’s establishment in 1933, SNGS has been nurturing generations
of accomplished young ladies who are anchored on sound values and driven
by passion and purpose.</p>
<p>As an old girl, I am also one of the beneficiaries of the all-rounded
education that all our girls experience in SNGS. I am deeply appreciative
of the opportunity to return to the school to serve as the principal, and
my 校长姐姐 (alumna Principal) identity is synonymous with the sisterly love
and family spirit that is so unique to our school. I hope to bring the
learning from my experiences as a teacher and school leader at the junior
college, secondary and primary levels, to enrich the educational journey
of our girls and develop them as <strong>Girls of Grace ▪ Women of Strength ▪ Leaders with Heart.</strong>
</p>
<p>As a catholic-mission SAP school, we offer a unique educational experience
- one that is future-oriented, yet rich in culture and heritage. As a full
school offering both a well-established GCE ‘O’ Level Programme (or the
Secondary Education Certificate course from the 2023 S1 cohort) as well
as an innovative Integrated Programme, we offer a range of enriching and
authentic learning experiences catering to the needs of our girls. Our
dynamic curriculum reflects our commitment to help every child realise
her fullest potential. Our girls enjoy an extensive range of holistic experiences
to help them cultivate their abilities and talents in pursuit of all-round
excellence. With the rich educational experience, many of our girls move
on to make an indelible mark and blaze new trails in numerous fields.</p>
<p>With a history spanning more than 9 decades, our rich traditions and enduring
ties have helped the school develop its own distinctive ethos and character.
Like a rich tapestry that weaves through the lives of every staff and students,
饮水思源 (gratitude) and 姐妹同心 (sisterly love) are deeply embedded in the St
Nick’s spirit. Our girls are blessed with many talents and are successful
in so many areas. Yet, they continue to live out the IJ motto of Simple
in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty, possessing the humility to learn and improve,
appreciating those who have helped them in ways big and small and placing
others before self. The strong family culture continues to grow in the
school. Our girls see each other as sisters, addressing each other affectionately
as 姐姐 or 妹妹 and the friendships formed in this school will stay with them
for the rest of their lives. Moving ahead, we will continue to strengthen
our spirit of gratitude and giving which has been so integral to the school’s
ethos.</p>
<p>As we prepare our girls for the increasingly complex world, the school
will continue to review and refresh our curriculum to ensure that our girls
have the necessary qualities, competencies and dispositions to succeed
in the future. Guided by our vision to develop them as <strong>Girls of Grace ▪ Women of Strength ▪ Leaders with Heart</strong>,
we hope that by the time our girls graduate, they would have developed
a strong moral compass to navigate changes, the resilience to persevere
through setbacks, and the desire to go beyond self to contribute to the
larger community. We are confident that our girls will continue to shine
brightly as role models and inspire the hearts and minds of those around
them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the adage goes, “It takes a village to raise a child.” The school is
blessed to have the amazing support of our “extended family” - the IJ Board,
our parents, alumni and partners. We would like to express our heartfelt
thanks and appreciation to all of them for their invaluable expertise,
unstinting help and countless sacrifices. Together, we will continue to
walk the journey with our girls. May the spirit of St Nicholas continue
to touch the lives of generations to come!</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h4><strong>校长献词</strong></h4>
<p>欢迎来到圣尼各拉大家庭！</p>
<p>自1933年建校以来，圣尼各拉女校始终致力于培养一代又一代优秀的年轻女性，她们秉承良好的价值观，怀抱热情和使命感，并不断追求卓越。</p>
<p>作为一名校友，我也得益于学校提供的全面教育。如今能够有机会回到母校担任校长，我深感荣幸与感恩。我的“校长姐姐”身份正体现了我们学校独特的姐妹情谊与家庭氛围。我希望通过我过去在初级学院、中学和小学的教学及领导经验，为我们的学生提供更丰富的学习旅程，帮助她们成长为“<strong>娴雅少女・坚毅巾帼・仁爱领袖</strong>”。</p>
<p>作为一所由天主教教会创办的特选学校，我们提供独特的教育体验——既面向未来，又深植于文化与传统之中。学校既开办久负盛名的剑桥O水准课程（中学教育课程），也有创新的综合课程，为学生提供多元而具真实性的学习体验，以满足她们的不同学习需求。我们丰富的课程内容体现了学校协助每位学生充分挖掘潜能的承诺。我们的学生参与多姿多彩的全面发展活动，培养她们的能力和才华，追求全面的卓越表现。借助这些丰富的教育体验，许多学生毕业后在多个领域取得了卓越成就，并开辟了新天地。</p>
<p>圣尼各拉创校已逾九十年，深厚的传统和历久弥新的师生情塑造了学校独特的精神风貌。“饮水思源”和“姐妹同心”的精神深深嵌入我们的校园文化中，就像贯穿教职员与学生生活的一幅精美织锦。我们的学生才华横溢，在许多领域表现优异。同时，她们始终践行圣婴学校共同的校训“德纯义坚”，怀着虚心学习与追求进步的谦逊之心，感谢那些在大大小小方面给予我们帮助的人，并能舍己为人。这根深蒂固的校园文化不断传承着。学生们情同姐妹，亲切地称对方为“姐姐”或“妹妹”，而在学校里建立的友谊将伴随她们一生。展望未来，我们将继续强化圣尼各拉文化中不可或缺的感恩与奉献精神。</p>
<p>在培养学生为日益复杂的世界做好准备时，学校将不断检视与更新教学，确保学生具备必要的素质，能力和品格，以在未来取得成功。在“<strong>娴雅少女・坚毅巾帼・仁爱领袖</strong>”愿景的指引下，我们希望学生在毕业时，已经培养出强大的道德指南针，能够应对各种变化所带来的挑战，具备克服挫折的韧性，并超越自我，为广大社群作出贡献。我们坚信，圣尼各拉学生将继续发光发热，成为他人的榜样，并启发身边的每一颗心灵。</p>
<p>所谓“教育一个孩子需举全村之力”，学校很幸运拥有圣尼各拉大家庭的支持——包括圣婴修女院董事会、家长、校友和合作伙伴。我们衷心感谢他们总是无私地分享专业知识，伸出援手并不断为学校付出。让我们携手共进，继续陪伴学生们成长。愿圣尼各拉精神继续继续影响一代又一代莘莘学子的生命！</p>
