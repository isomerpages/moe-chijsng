Our school maintains a **‘No-Entry’** policy to all except for staff and students during school hours.

Drive-in is allowed in the morning during school arrival time for parents sending their children to school. For school dismissal time, parents who drive can park their cars in nearby public car parks before fetching their children from school at **Gate 1 (along St 13), Gate 2 (along AMK Ave 2) and Gate 3 (Car park 26).**

All visitors with scheduled appointments to meet staff will have to register at the Guard Post before entering school.
