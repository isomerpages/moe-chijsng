#### Respect for our Nation &amp; School

*   All Singapore citizens are to sing the National Anthem and recite the National Pledge with fervour. They will recite the National Pledge with their right fists placed over their hearts.
*   Pupils who are not Singapore citizens must stand at attention and remain silent whenever the National Anthem is sung and the National Pledge is recited.
*   All pupils must sing the School Song and recite the Students’ Pledge with fervour. They will recite the Students’ Pledge with their right fists placed over their chests.
*   All pupils will join in to pray or remain silent and adopt a respectful disposition during prayer times.
*   Pupils will be dealt with, accordingly, if the above are not observed.

#### Respect for Self &amp; Others

At all times, pupils are to:

*   be courteous, gracious and practise good social etiquette;
*   be kind, generous, and considerate to others;
*   be appreciative and not take things for granted.

#### Assignments, Tests, &amp; Examinations

*   All pupils are to submit all assignments properly and punctually. Late assignments may incur a penalty in terms of marks or be awarded no marks at all.
*   All pupils must sit for all scheduled tests and examinations unless they have been certified medically unfit. A medical certificate must be produced within three days of the test. Otherwise, the pupil will be awarded a score of zero for that test or examination. No arrangements would be made for pupils to sit for the paper on another day.
*   A pupil is considered to have cheated during a test or examination if she is found attempting to obtain or offer unfair assistance (e.g. copy from another candidate, allow another pupil to copy her test or examination answers, or commit a dishonest act). Other attempts to cheat include being found with notes, books, unauthorised materials, or electronic communication devices during a test or examination (whether intentional or not). For the above, the pupil will be awarded a score of zero for that test or examination and face possible debarment from sitting for subsequent papers.

#### Attire

*   Pupils are to wear the prescribed school uniform (as illustrated on pages 18 and 19), without any modifications, when reporting for, attending, and leaving school and school events. Special attire (such as PE, CCA, House, or approved class T-shirts and sports shoes) required for specific activities are allowed only during those activities.
*   Pupils are to don their pinafore an hour after PE lessons and when they leave school after CCA.
*   For CCA during the holidays, pupils are to don their pinafore with PE or CCA T-shirt when reporting for activities and leaving school.
*   Nails are to be kept clean and short, without nail polish.
*   Jewellery, including necklaces and bracelets, are not allowed. Also not allowed are inappropriate body art, such as tattoos, and the piercing of any part of the body except the ears. 
*   Students will be allowed to wear **one pair of ear sticks or ear studs at the lowest point of the earlobe**. The update guidelines are: (1) only one pair of identical clear, transparent, colourless ear sticks with circle stoppers to be worn at the lowest point of the earlobe, (2) only one pair of identical round, single-coloured gold or silver ear studs, not exceeding 3mm in diameter, to be worn at the lowest point of the earlobe. Silver-coloured steel and titanium are allowed. Ear studs with gems are not allowed.
*   Students are encouraged to remove their ear studs if there is a safety risk during physical activities. They are responsible for their own belongings and the school will not be liable for the loss of any ear studs or ear sticks.

#### Hairstyle

*   Hairstyles must be neat and appropriate for school, and not fanciful.
*   Hair must not be dyed, tinted, or highlighted. Hair extensions are not permitted.
