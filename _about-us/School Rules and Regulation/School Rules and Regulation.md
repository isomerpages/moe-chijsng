### Respect for our Nation & School

*   All Singapore citizens are to sing the National Anthem and recite the National Pledge with fervour. They will recite the National Pledge with their right fists placed over their hearts.
*   Pupils who are not Singapore citizens must stand at attention and remain silent whenever the National Anthem is sung and the National Pledge is recited.
*   All pupils must sing the School Song and recite the Students’ Pledge with fervour. They will recite the Students’ Pledge with their right fists placed over their chests.
*   All pupils will join in to pray or remain silent and adopt a respectful disposition during prayer times.
*   Pupils will be dealt with, accordingly, if the above are not observed.

### Respect for Self & Others

At all times, pupils are to:

*   be courteous, gracious and practise good social etiquette;
*   be kind, generous, and considerate to others;
*   be appreciative and not take things for granted.

### Assignments, Tests, & Examinations

*   All pupils are to submit all assignments properly and punctually. Late assignments may incur a penalty in terms of marks or be awarded no marks at all.
*   All pupils must sit for all scheduled tests and examinations unless they have been certified medically unfit. A medical certificate must be produced within three days of the test. Otherwise, the pupil will be awarded a score of zero for that test or examination. No arrangements would be made for pupils to sit for the paper on another day.
*   A pupil is considered to have cheated during a test or examination if she is found attempting to obtain or offer unfair assistance (e.g. copy from another candidate, allow another pupil to copy her test or examination answers, or commit a dishonest act). Other attempts to cheat include being found with notes, books, unauthorised materials, or electronic communication devices during a test or examination (whether intentional or not). For the above, the pupil will be awarded a score of zero for that test or examination and face possible debarment from sitting for subsequent papers.

### Attire

*   Pupils are to wear the prescribed school uniform (as illustrated on pages 18 and 19), without any modifications, when reporting for, attending, and leaving school and school events. Special attire (such as PE, CCA, House, or approved class T-shirts and sports shoes) required for specific activities are allowed only during those activities.
*   Pupils are to don their pinafore an hour after PE lessons and when they leave school after CCA.
*   For CCA during the holidays, pupils are to don their pinafore with PE or CCA T-shirt when reporting for activities and leaving school.
*   Jewellery, including earrings, ear studs, and coloured ear sticks, are not allowed. Also not allowed are inappropriate body art, such as tattoos, and the piercing of any part of the body except the ears.
*   Nails are to be kept clean and short, without nail polish.

### Hairstyle

*   Hairstyles must be neat and appropriate for school, and not fanciful.
*   Hair must not be dyed, tinted, or highlighted. Hair extensions are not permitted.
*   Hair that is at least shoulder-length must be neatly tied up; fringes must be trimmed and kept above the eyebrows at all times.
*   Hair accessories must be kept simple and be either black or dark blue in colour.

### Respect for Personal & School Property

At all times, pupils are to:

*   keep every part of the school clean and beautiful;
*   conserve water and electricity;
*   seek permission from the appropriate parties before using items;
*   return all borrowed items to the appropriate parties promptly and in good condition;
*   report any equipment fault to the relevant parties promptly.

### Punctuality & Attendance

*   At all times, pupils are to be punctual in reporting for school, lessons, tests, examinations, and activities. Unless otherwise specified, the school day begins at 7.30 am.
*   Pupils who are not present with their classes when the flag-raising ceremony starts are considered late.
*   Pupils are to participate in all enrichment and co-curricular activities. A medical certificate should be produced for absence from any school activity.

### Electronic Devices

*   Electronic devices, including mobile phones, digital cameras, personal digital assistants, media players, laptops and game consoles, must be switched off, kept away and not used during curriculum and CCA time, failing which, they will be confiscated.
*   Personal electronic devices must not be charged in school, or else they will be confiscated.
*   Confiscated electronic devices may only be claimed from the Operations Manager the following Monday, during the morning or afternoon break.
*   Pupils are responsible and accountable for the safekeeping of their personal belongings.

#### If there is any breach of school conduct and non observance of school rules, the pupil will be dealt with accordingly.
