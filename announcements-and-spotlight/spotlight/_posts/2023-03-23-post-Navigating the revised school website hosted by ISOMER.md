Dear visitor,

Our school website has just been migrated to the ISOMER platform in Apr 2023.

We have made necessary changes in line with the current capabilities of the new platform, and also took the opportunity to reorganise some of the content on the main, primary and secondary sections of the website.

Here is a guide to help you navigate the school website.
